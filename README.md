# Undertale_UE5_Template
A template for Undertale fangames, still a WIP, but when it's done it'll basically be Undertale made completely from scratch in Unreal Engine 5.

**What is this?**

This is a (currently WIP) template for Undertale fangames that you can use free of charge! I made this because I wanted to be able to make my own Undertale fangame but I have very little coding experience and trying to make a mod for the vanilla game was too hard for me to figure out. Unreal engine is much easier to use than Unity and Gamemaker Studio, so I decided to start practising with some other projects before moving on to beginning this project. Thanks to the UE5 community for any help I may have needed along the way and the Spriter's Resource for all of the sprites I needed to make this.

**When will it be done?**

I have no clue. It takes a long time to make games, especially when it's a game as complex as Undertale, and I want to make sure I get it as close to the vanilla game as possible while also making it flexible for fangame makers.

**Did you get permission from Toby Fox to do this?**

Lmao nope, I don't even know if he'd allow me to make this or if he'd sue me, but let's hope that doesn't happen.
